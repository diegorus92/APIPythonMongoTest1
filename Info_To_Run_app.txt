in console execute this commands in the next order:

    set FLASK_APP=[file where is create_app() function].py
    $env:FLASK_APP="[file where is create_app() function].py"
    flask run

The first two commands only need to execute once while
Pycharm is not closed, then only use flask run command for start server always.
If Pycharm is closed, and opened again, we'll need to execute the three commands again

Example with this proyect:
    set FLASK_APP=__init__.py
    $env:FLASK_APP="__init__.py"
    flask run

NOTE:
-In this case, __init__file.py in the root folder is where we define the create_app() function. Is there where the proyect start.
-Remember execute those commands in console from the root folder. In this case "\ApiPythonMongoTest1"
-In set FLASK_APP, file name it's not surrounded by "", but in $env:FLASK_APP, file name it need to be surrounded by ""
-Maybe it would be a good idea, create main.py and his __init__.py into root folder
